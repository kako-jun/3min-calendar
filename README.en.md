## Why I Created This App

"I want to post my shop's business calendar on Instagram."

When I searched for how to do this, all I found was **editing Canva templates every month**.

- Grid lines misalign, manual position adjustments needed
- Manually mark holidays in red every month
- Repeat the same work every month...

**"This is too much hassle!"**

But there was no dedicated app for this.

So I built one.

Just tap buttons. Holidays are automatic. Done in 3 minutes.

I hope this gives busy small business owners a little more time back.

## How to Use (3 Easy Steps)

### Step 1: Tap a date to edit

Tap a date on the calendar, and an editor appears below.

- **"Closed"** → Closed day
- **"◯"** → Available
- **"△"** → Limited availability
- **"✕"** → Reserved
- **"Full"** → Fully booked

Just tap the buttons!

You can also add time slots and custom comments.

### Step 2: Set your shop name (optional)

Tap the **⚙️ Settings** button in the top right to set your shop name and logo.

It will appear in the top left of the calendar image.

### Step 3: Share or Save

- **📤 Share** → Post directly to Instagram, LINE, X, etc.
- **💾 Save** → Save the image to your phone or computer

**※ "Share screen" permission is required each time**

When you tap "Share" or "Save", you'll see a "Share your screen?" confirmation.

This is required to save the calendar as an image.
Tap "Allow".

(For security reasons, this confirmation appears every time)

## QR Code Generator

Tap the "QR" tab at the top to open the QR code generator.

- Enter your shop's website or social media URL
- Customize the QR code design (colors, shape, logo)
- Download your QR code

### Why We Added QR Code Feature

Some free QR code generators redirect through shady ad sites or tracking services.

**Many shop owners unknowingly give these QR codes to their customers.**

Please scan your current shop QR code with your own phone right now.

If it shows an unfamiliar shortened URL instead of your shop's URL... it was created by a scam site.

We recommend recreating it with this app.

This app's QR code feature works **completely offline**.

Like DENSO WAVE (the inventor of QR codes), we encode your URL directly without any modification.

Use it with confidence.

### Q. What is Rokuyo?

Rokuyo are traditional Japanese lucky/unlucky days like "Taian" (lucky) and "Butsumetsu" (unlucky).
